TODO:
1. Add directions (full day of work probably)
2. Fix the sort function on the table so users can sort by any value
3. Write an algorithm for finding closest locations to a user using the google maps apiWrite an algorithm to change the focus of the map to focus on a cluster of map markers once they show up on a map if a user chooses a zipcode that corresponds to multiple clinics 
4. Design custom marker icons with info panels.
